        <strong>What is a cookie?</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        A cookie is a small text file which is downloaded to your device or
        browser when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the
        originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that
        recognises that cookie, in order to develop a record of the user’s
        online activity. Cookies may be delivered by the website a user visits,
        or by third parties. First party cookies are set by BlackRock and belong
        to the website domain that appears in the browser address bar.
