        <strong>BlackRock Privacy Notice</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        Last revised: 1 March 2025
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Introduction</strong>
        <br /> <br />
        BlackRock is committed to safeguarding and processing personal
        information <strong>(“PI”)</strong>, including sensitive personal
        information <strong>(“SPI”)</strong> , in line with all applicable
        privacy and data protection laws. Many of our offices are located in
        countries with laws governing the processing of PI. “BlackRock”, “we”,
        “us” or “our” means BlackRock, Inc., each of the direct or indirect
        subsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc. <strong>(the “BlackRock Group”)</strong>{" "}
        and BlackRock managed products. BlackRock, Inc., BlackRock Group
        functions and the entity you contract with are the controllers of your
        PI. Where we process your PI without a contract with you, the controller
        is the entity providing you with this Privacy Notice.
        <br />
        <br />
        References to “you” or “your” refers to individuals whose PI is
        processed by BlackRock, including individual investors, individuals in
        the alternative business industry, client employees, officers or agents
        (together “Representatives”) with direct or indirect relationships (such
        as those who invest through an intermediary); and beneficial owners of
        an organization or entity in connection with:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
        <li>the provision of services to potential and actual clients;</li>
        <li>
          transactions to which we are party (including those which we effect on
          behalf of clients); or
        </li>
        <li>services provided to us by a third-party vendor.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-[16px]/[24px] text-[#000000]">
        If your contract is with the BlackRock Group, the BlackRock entity you
        contract with will be the controller of your PI. If you are an investor
        in a BlackRock managed product, the associated BlackRock management
        company and the managed product, if a separate legal entity, will be
        separate controllers. This privacy notice applies to your relationship
        with BlackRock.
        <br />
        <br />
        This Privacy Notice sets out the purposes for which we collect, use, and
        disclose (collectively <strong>“Processing”)</strong> PI and how it is
        protected. It also sets outs individuals’ rights in relation to the
        processing of their PI.
        <br />
        <br />
        There may be additional terms, conditions and commitments that also
        govern how we collect, use and disclose your PI, which should be read in
        conjunction with this Privacy Notice.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>PI we collect about you</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        PI is information relating to an individual, which can be used either
        alone or with other sources of information to identify that individual.
        PI does not include information where the identity of the individual or
        the specific detail of the information has been removed and is therefore
        non-attributable. Depending on your jurisdiction, SPI is a sub-category
        of PI that may include PI relating to race or ethnicity, government
        identifiers, geolocation information, religious or philosophical
        beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union
        membership, information about health and genetic and biometric data,
        among others.
        <br />
        <br />
        The nature of the information that we collect will depend on the
        services provided, applicable laws and our relationship with you. We
        categorize the PI we may process as follows (the PI listed for each
        category are non-exhaustive examples):

        data protection laws, we apply the same level of security and
        organizational controls to the processing of PI wherever it is

        In certain jurisdictions, you will need to expressly consent to receive
        marketing emails. If you are an authenticated user on our websites and
        platform, we may provide you with a personalized experience based on
        your user behaviour.
        <br />
        <br />
        In all jurisdictions, you can choose not to receive such communications
        at any time by clicking on marketing opt-out links in any electronic
        marketing materials we send you, by making a request to your usual
        BlackRock contact, by using the contact details set out in the
        “Contacting Us” section of this Privacy Notice, or, in relation to

        <strong>Third-party marketing/sale of PI</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        Some entities in the BlackRock Group may sell certain PI. For example,
        Preqin sells Identification data; Contact data; and Professional
        Information data to its customers who subscribe to certain of our
        databases for their own purposes, including marketing. We also share for
        targeted advertising or cross-context behavioral advertising purposes
        the following categories of PI to advertising networks and social media
        networks: Profile and Interaction data; Technical data; and Marketing,
        Behavioral and Communications data. We do not knowingly sell or share
        personal information of individuals under 16 years of age.
        <br />
        <br />
        Because of certain of these activities, Preqin, a BlackRock Group
        member, is a data broker under Texas law. To conduct business in Texas,
        a data broker must register with the Texas Secretary of State (Texas
        SOS). Information about data broker registrants is available on the
        Texas SOS website at https://www.sos.state.tx.us/index.shtml.

        <br />
        You will find information on your right to opt-out from such processing
        in the section “Your rights”.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>PI retention</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        We will process your PI for as long as is necessary to fulfil the
        purpose for which it was collected or to comply with legal, regulatory,
        accounting, reporting, internal policy requirements or for the
        establishment or defense of legal claims.

        We use a range of physical, electronic, and managerial measures designed
        to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of PI processing.
        These measures may include:
