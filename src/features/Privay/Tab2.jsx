        <strong>BlackRock Recruitment Privacy Notice</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        Last revised: 1 June 2024
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Introduction</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        BlackRock is committed to processing personal information (“PI”),
        including sensitive personal information (“SPI”), in line with all
        applicable privacy and data protection laws. Most of our offices are
        located in countries which have laws governing the processing of PI.
        “BlackRock”, “we”, “us” or “our” means BlackRock, Inc., and each of the
        direct or indirect subsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc., (the “
        <strong>BlackRock Group</strong>”).
        <br />
        <br />
        This Privacy Notice (“Notice”) sets out the purposes for which we
        collect, use and disclose (collectively “processing”) PI during the
        recruitment process and how it is protected. References to “you” or
        “your” relate to individuals who have applied for a position as a summer
        analyst, on the internship program (also called the Student Program), as
        a fixed term employee or for a permanent position.
        <br />
        <br />
        We may also provide you with additional information regarding the
        processing of your PI specific to a particular part of the recruitment
        process. Any such additional information should be read in conjunction
        with this Notice.
        <br />
        <br />
        This Notice does not override any rights you may have under relevant
        employment law.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>PI we collect about you</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        PI is information relating to an individual, which can be used either
        alone or with other sources of information to identify that individual.
        PI does not include information where the identity of the individual has
        been removed and is therefore non-attributable. SPI is a sub-category of
        PI that includes PI that relates to race or ethnicity, religious or
        philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions,
        trade union membership, information about health and genetic and
        biometric data. Not all countries define SPI in their privacy and data
        protection laws.
        <br />
        <br />
        PI, including SPI, that we may collect about you will vary depending on
        the stage of the recruitment process you are and can be categorized as
        follows (the PI listed for each category are non-exhaustive examples):

          <br />
          In limited circumstances, where relevant to the recruitment process
          and where allowed or required by law, we may collect SPI including

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-[16px]/[24px] text-black">
        We may also process PI on third parties where relevant to the
        recruitment process, for example we will ask you to declare close
        personal or financial relationships with current BlackRock employees
        and/or clients and business partners to manage conflicts of interest,
        fraud, and other <br /> financial crime. We are also required by law to
        determine whether you are a politically exposed person (“PEP”) and may
        process PI on individuals connected to you that are considered to be
        PEPs.
        <br />
        <br />
        We collect PI in several ways including:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-4 my-4 text-[16px]/[24px] text-black">
        <li>
          <strong>Careers Websites</strong>
          <br />
          PI submitted by you when you respond to a recruitment advert and/or
          create a profile through our Careers or Student Recruitment websites.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Social Media Sites</strong>
          <br />
          We may use PI you make publicly available to reach out to you for
          recruitment purposes or to consider you as a future talent. If we do
          this, you will be given the ability to opt out of having your record
          retained in our Talent Community files and/or receiving any further
          information about career opportunities with BlackRock.
          <br />
          <br />
          PI submitted by you when you respond to a recruitment advert on a
          social media site.
          <br />
          <br />
          When you choose to provide us with a link to your profile on social
          media sites (such as LinkedIn), as part of your application we will
          collect PI from certain fields on these sites and combine this with
          other data captured through the online application form to create a
          single profile. We will not collect your photographs or videos without
          letting you know first unless you submit a photograph or video
          voluntarily as part of your application.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Talent Community</strong>
          <br />
          When joining the talent community, we may automatically enrich your
          profile to ensure completeness and accuracy of information using
          publicly available information. You will always be notified before
          enrichment happens and will always be provided with the ability to opt
          out of this functionality.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Recruitment Agencies</strong>
          <br />
          Your PI may be provided to us by recruitment agencies you have
          registered with if they feel a BlackRock vacancy may be of interest to
          you. Where a recruitment agency refers you to us, a profile will be
          created for you in our recruitment database based on the information
          provided and you will receive a notification asking you to log in and
          complete your candidate profile through a BlackRock owned website.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Third Party Sources</strong>
          <br />
          We may collect your PI from other third-party sources during the
          recruitment process such as through references from previous
          employers.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-[16px]/[24px] text-black">
        Unless we otherwise indicate that the provision of specific PI is
        optional, any PI we request is necessary for us to progress your
        application. If you provide false, misleading or inaccurate PI we
        reserve the right not to progress your application further and/or to
        withdraw an offer of employment.

        we may transfer PI to a location outside of the country w here you

        in the USA, Hungary, India and Singapore. Although the country to which

        controls to the processing of PI wherever it is processed. We require by
        contract that our third-party service providers processing PI on our
        behalf to comply with BlackRock’s criteria for PI processing.
        <br />
        <br />
        If we transfer PI out of the EEA, we ensure a similar level of
        protection for your PI by ensuring the country is considered by the EU
        Commission to provide an adequate level of protection, putting in p lace
        contractual clauses the EU Commission consider to provide the same level
        of protection.

        <li>
          <strong>Object</strong>
          <br />
          To object to the processing of your PI if (i) we are processing your
          PI on the grounds of legitimate interests or for the performance of a
          task in the public interest (including profiling) or (ii) if we are
          processing your PI for direct marketing purposes or (iii) your PI is
          subject to automatic enrichment in our talent community.

          <strong>Correction</strong>
          <br />
          To request that we update the PI we process in relation to you or

          To request manual intervention if you are subject to automated

        We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm
        your identity and ensure your right to access to the PI requested, or to
        exercise any of your other rights. This is to ensure that PI is not

        us to locate the PI processed in relation to you, for example the
        position you have applied for and in which country.

        We aim to respond to all legitimate requests within one calendar month.
