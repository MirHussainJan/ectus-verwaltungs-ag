        <strong>BlackRock Alumni Privacy Notice</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        Last revised: 1 June 2024
        <br />
        <br />
        Welcome to the BlackRock Alumni Website (“Alumni Website”). BlackRock is
        committed to processing personal information (“PI”) in line with all
        applicable privacy and data protection laws. “BlackRock”, “we”, “us” or
        “our” means BlackRock, Inc., and each of the direct or indirect
        subsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>PI we collect about you</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        PI is information relating to an individual, which can be used either
        alone or with other sources of information to identify that individual.
        PI does not include information where the identity of the individual has
        been removed and is therefore non-attributable.
        <br />
        <br />
        To join BlackRock’s alumni network, you will be asked to submit an
        application on our Alumni Website. Your participation in our network is
        entirely your choice. As part of your application, we may collect the
        following PI that can be categorized as follows (the PI listed for each
        category are non-exhaustive examples):
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-4 my-4 text-[16px]/[24px] text-black">

          <br />
          Current employment status, management title, line of business,
          employment experience, education, board memberships, BlackRock email
          address, information relating to your time at BlackRock, including
          management level, city last worked, line of business, title, and time
          of joining and leaving BlackRock.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-[16px]/[24px] text-black">
        Unless we otherwise indicate that the provision of specific PI is
        optional, any PI we request from you is necessary to progress your
        application to become a member of the BlackRock alumni network.

        <strong>How long your PI is retained for</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        We will process your PI for as long as is necessary to fulfil the
        purpose for which it was collected or to comply with legal, regulatory,
        accounting, reporting, internal policy requirements or for the
        establishment or defence of legal claims.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>How your PI is protected</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        BlackRock implements technical and organizational measures to
        appropriately protect PI against unauthorized, accidental, or unlawful
        destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to
        PI transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Transfers of PI</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        We are a global organization and in the course of running our business,
        we may transfer PI to a location outside of the country where you
        reside, including BlackRock processing centers in the USA, Hungary,
        India and Singapore. Although the country to which PI may be transferred
        may not have the same level of privacy and data protection laws, we
        apply the same level of security and organizational controls to the
        processing of PI wherever it is processed. We require by contract that
        our service providers processing PI on our behalf comply with
        BlackRock’s criteria for PI processing.
        <br />
        <br />
        If we transfer PI out of the EEA, we ensure a similar level of
        protection for your PI by ensuring the country is considered by the EU
        Commission to provide an adequate level of protection or by putting in
        place contractual clauses the EU Commission considers to provide the
        same level of protection.
